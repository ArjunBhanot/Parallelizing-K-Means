# Parallelizing-K-Means

K-means algorithm has been re-designed to run in parallel manner by using the message passing
technique of parallelization. LAM-MPI (Local Area Multicomputer â€“ Message Passing Interface)
utility has been used in order to implement the parallelized version of K-means algorithm
